# RastLess / Rasdaman Benchmarks

This repository has all the code to reproduce the results, which were created for my bachelor thesis "Serverless
Computing and its Potential for Cloud Native Geoprocessing".

To run the code is not possible for the public, because credentials are not provided.
This repository can be seen as read only, but is public for reviewing the code.
